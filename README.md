Calculated Risk — Master Investor Report
Executive Summary
Calculated Risk’s updated financial model incorporates three major growth levers:
1. Tiered pricing & expansion into new sports markets.
2. Nudge Feature: a $5 one-day pass during NFL Playoffs and an annual upsell, adding ~3% ARR with conservative adoption.
3. Referral Incentive: $7.50 off for referrers, $5 off for new users, only granted if the new user maintains ≥53% adoption. This ensures low CAC and aligns with our brand story.
Market Opportunity
The U.S. sports betting market is projected to surpass $180 billion in annual handle by 2030. There are an estimated 20 million active U.S. sports gamblers. Even if Calculated Risk captures just 1% (~200,000 users), at $20–$80 per month this represents tens of millions in ARR. We only need a sliver of this market to be profitable.
