  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">About Calculated Risk</h1>
  <p>We are not a sportsbook — we are strictly an AI-driven data analytics company. Born from a <em>bored room, not a boardroom</em>, Calculated Risk is built for fans and sharps who want sharper insights, cleaner data, and tools that turn odds into opportunities.</p>

  <p>Our founder is a data scientist who understands both the thrill and frustration of navigating probabilities. That experience drives us to design models that put the power in the user’s hands. Unlike “the house,” we aim to even the playing field — empowering you to calculate, challenge, and reshape risk.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Mission</h2>
  <p>To deliver defensible analytics that help our community make more informed, responsible, and confident decisions.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Vision</h2>
  <p>To build the most trusted, user-driven sports analytics platform — one that continuously evolves through community feedback, modeling innovations, and transparency.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Our Approach</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
    <li><strong>User-First:</strong> Built for consumers, not corporations.</li>
    <li><strong>Agnostic About Gambling:</strong> We focus on providing data, not opinions.</li>
    <li><strong>Sharpening the Edge:</strong> With backtesting, modeling, and unrivaled features, we help reduce the gap between “just staying in the game” (53% hit rate) and winning consistently.</li>
    <li><strong>Community-Driven:</strong> Our models grow stronger as users interact, share feedback, and stress-test insights.</li>
  </ul>

README USE THIS DRAFT TEXT to UPDATE PAGE<<<<If you click on “About” we will have some sort of blurb about how we are strictly an AI driven data analytics company. We are a one man with a machine. We were produced from a bored room, not a boardroom! That means we are a consumer focused company and want to provide the most insight and ease of use from our many ways of analyzing data combinations and probabilities. We have no opinion on the gambling industry/try to be agnostic about it or such, we know how to get the data users want as the founder is a data scientist. Our goal is to look at the odds and turn them in your favor. We are risk calculators providing an educational, entertainment, and gaming tool. We are community driven and will use user feedback to continuously grow our models strength and accuracy overtime and allows for community, we are not the house! Some other you come up with. Provide a mission and vision statement. Write something generic about the founder being a data scientist, who is constantly working to change the odds away from the house and toward the user or something. We were designed for users looking for better angles, sharper insights, because we are that user. Mention something about how betters only need to be right about 53% to remain in the game and how we aim to shrink the gap with our modeling, backtesting, and unrivaled features. We don’t just beat odds, we rearrange them in your favor.>>>>
